Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Risk Prioritization
This project demonstrates how to perform a Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Prioritization using Nessus Essentials (primary tool) and OpenVAS (alternative).
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, assess their severity using CVE & CVSS, classify risks, and prioritize remediation.

🛠 Tools

Nessus Essentials

OpenVAS

CVE Database

CVSS Scoring System

🔍 Methodology

Define scope and target systems

Configure scan settings

Run vulnerability scan

Review and validate findings

Map vulnerabilities to CVE IDs

Analyze CVSS scores

Classify risks (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Prioritize and recommend remediation

📊 Risk Classification
Severity	CVSS Score	Action
Critical	9.0–10.0	Immediate Fix
High	7.0–8.9	Urgent
Medium	4.0–6.9	Moderate
Low	0.1–3.9	Monitor
🛡 Remediation
